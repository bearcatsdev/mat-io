                    <h3>About MAT I/O</h3>
                </p>
                <p><span class="bold">A Great Welcoming Party for MAT Students.</span><br>
                    MAT I/O is an annual welcoming party event for all students of Mobile Application and Technology. We
                    believe that every one of us should excel through innovation and togetherness. This event is open
                    for active MAT students of all classes and semesters. Even some of your favourite lecturers may come
                    to I/O as well!</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Connecting the Dots</span><br>
                    This year, our theme is, as you have guessed it, "Connecting the Dots". Just like the theme, we hope
                    that this event can help you to build networks and connections to more people, including MAT
                    students and professionals.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Innovation Included</span><br>
                    Of course, this event would not be called "I/O" without showcasing innovation. Beware of our new
                    students who will present their great ideas as part of MAT Ideathon, their first contest of mobile
                    app concept organized by us. They could present crazy, wild ideas that can change Indonesia and the
                    world. Furthermore, they will be finally judged to determine the true winners of the contest.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Finally, Performances!</span><br>
                    This event would not be more exciting without performances. Stay tuned for more information of our
                    performers lists!
